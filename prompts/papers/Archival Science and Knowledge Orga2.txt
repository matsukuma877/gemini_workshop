Abstract: We discuss the aspects and points of contact between knowledge organization and archival science,
based on the texts published in the scope of the International Society of Knowledge Organization, especially
concerning classification and description, building a theoretical-conceptual parallel about their points of contact.
The aim is to systematize the relations between knowledge organization and archival science within the scope of
classification and description. Bibliographic research in ISKO literature and archival literature was performed.
Through systematization, it was possible to understand how the relationship between these fields is carried out and how it can be strength-
ened. The field of knowledge organization makes a pivotal contribution to the development of methodologies to access information. A
series of developments in languages, structures and classifications, that is, knowledge organization systems (KOSs), is presented. On the
other hand, archival science has been developing simultaneously, but in many moments seeking interlocutions, although superficial or even
unintentional with the field of knowledge organization. The approximation of these fields is essential for the development of archival
classification and description, aiming for the construction of ontologies, taxonomies and controlled vocabularies among others. These
recent approximations must have occurred due to the changes that have happened in the last twenty years in relation to records management
and the way people build knowledge and seek information. Also, it is possible to apply KOSs in the administrative digital environment for
better archival representation instruments.

1.0 Introduction
Knowledge organization (KO) is a field that contributes
fundamentally to the development of methodologies for
representing a given domain; KO methodologies help give a
better understanding of knowledge itself reflecting in ways
to access information. In this regard, a series of develop-
ments has been presented for the construction of languages,
structures, classifications, that is, systems of knowledge or-
ganization. On the other hand, archival science has devel-
oped in parallel, but, in many moments, seeking interlocu-
tions although superficial or even unintentional with the
field of knowledge organization, as is the case with the de-
velopment of some requirements of archival descriptionhttps://doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-7-493, am 17.01.2025, 06:30:39

standards, ontologies, taxonomies and controlled vocabular-
ies among others. However, they contribute punctually and,
in many cases, peripherally to the mainstream of world ar-
chival thinking which, in many cases, is related to national
recordkeeping practices.
These approximations, which were often not so bright,
originated due to the fact that in the last twenty years, there
were changes in how administrative management pro-
duces, transmits and accesses information and along the
way, how people construct knowledge and seek infor-
mation. On the other hand, as Navarro (1995) points out,
the field of knowledge organization itself has for a long
time relegated the issue of archival records organization to
a secondary role as a domain apart from KO itself. From
1980, in the field of archival science, there has been an in-
tensification of work dedicated to the subjects that we can
relate to KO, such as classification schemes and concep-
tions of organization systems, but with minimal relation to
the KO literature, which, in our opinion and within this
paper and this particular issue, we think that there is an
excellent potential for both fields.
On the other hand, in the current context, the produc-
tion of archival records has a hybrid situation in which paper
documents are produced concomitantly with digital records
and vice versa, in most countries (Barros 2016, 34). Regard-
ing this, the processes of representation and organization of
knowledge in archival contexts are studied in archival sci-
ence in a compartmentalized way dissociated from a sys-
temic view, to the construction as a whole. The advent of
knowledge organization systems as part of a representation
process of information contained in archival records is
hardly noticeable in the theoretical-methodological context
of archival science, and its use often occurs in an “impro-
vised” way.
Systems of knowledge organization are basically, as
Dahlberg (1993, 211) postulates, “based on knowledge
units—which are nothing else but concepts. Concepts con-
sist of concept elements, also called concept characteristics,
and exactly these are the factors by which concept sys-
tems—and classification systems are such concept sys-
tems—can be constructed.”
As a scientific field, knowledge organization can be based
on several axes of study, especially those according to Hjør-
land (2016): 1) practical and intuitive approaches; 2) consen-
sus-based approaches; 3) approaches based on facet analy-
sis; 4) cognitive and user-based approaches; and, 5) domain
analysis and epistemological approaches.
Thus, its scientific field can be and is related to archival
science and records management, precisely when one thinks
about the possibilities of approaches concerning the sys-
tems of organization. Because records management, classi-
fication, access, and control systems are just that—concep-
tual systems based on characteristics of record-producing
institutions—and we lack objectivity in the development of
our organizational schemes, archival science consensus-
based approaches, facet analysis, user and domain analysis
can have a significant impact on organizations that depend
on records to work.
In this sense, in this article we seek to draw a theoretical
overview of the possible points of connection between
KO and archival science in a theoretical and methodolog-
ical way. As highlighted by Hjørland (2016, 100):
Knowledge organization of archives should, how-
ever, also be considered part of KO ... Archives may
contain official records, business records, images,
letters, diplomas, etc. The most important principle
of organization for this domain is the principle of
provenance.
Thus, it is essential to emphasize that archival knowledge or-
ganization, compared to other fields related to KO is, above
all, an intersection with distinctive characteristics. Therefore,
it is a theoretical reflection in the first instance, as it studies
the systems of knowledge organization in the universe of
archives and their relations and points of contact, but there
is also a methodological study as it seeks to systematize these
points with regard to classification and archival descrip-
tion—its application in the reality of the archives—from
this correlation. Barros and Tognoli (2015, 95) point out
that, “It is believed that it is possible to understand the work
of archival representation as a form of organization of
knowledge, that is, the Archival Science as an interdiscipli-
nary area with the organization of knowledge.” In this con-
text, several papers have discussed the relations between KO
and archival science, such as Barros and Tognoli (2015), Bar-
ros (2016), Barros and Gomes (2018), and Sousa and Araújo
Jr. (2013 and 2017). We can also add several ISKO confer-
ences, in which archival science researchers publish and pre-
sent papers correlating aspects of KO with archival science.
First, foundations of the organization and representation
of knowledge are discussed, seeking to demarcate its field
of action. Next, KO is correlated with archival theory in re-
lation to classification and description. Finally, a parallel is
established between them. The aim is proposing a possible
approach between these areas.
2.0 Archival science and knowledge organization:
first approaches
Knowledge organization as a field represents a specializa-
tion for information science, that is, a socially and scientifi-
cally institutionalized study stage within the area of infor-
mation science, to discuss theories and methodologies re-
lated to the various processes of representation and organi-
zation. As Mazzocchi (2018, 55) postulates: “knowledge or-https://doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-7-493, am 17.01.2025, 06:30:39

ganization ... as a distinct field, [is] considered today as sub-
field (or as linked to library and information science).” It is,
therefore, a field that will seek to study aspects of the con-
struction of thesauri, controlled vocabularies, taxonomies,
and ontologies, that is, a range of instruments-processes
that seek the search and appropriation of knowledge, tradi-
tionally linked to library and information science.
Thus, processes traditionally linked to knowledge organ-
ization and representation are linked to library and infor-
mation science. In this regard, the methods of reading, anal-
ysis, and construction of specialized languages are mostly
related to this universe, but according to the trajectory of
knowledge organization and representation, the main con-
cern is the content and its representation of a given domain.
Even though, in the case of archives, the context is the es-
sential element of this organization through records prove-
nance and its organic relation, we can improve the classifi-
cation context with complementary tools based on KOSs.
There is a very present need to discuss and apply content-
based strategies representing a given administrative domain
to its organization as a complementary tool for records
management, classification, and description. As pointed out,
it is not a shift from traditional archival science views; it’s an
interrelation between fields.
The process of construction of this field can be based
on the authors pointed out by Mazzocchi (2018, 55): “Cutter
(1837–1903), Richardson (1860–1939), Sayers (1881–1960)
and, of course, Bliss (1870–1955), who used the term KO
in two seminal books, The Organization of Knowledge and the
System of the Sciences (1929), and The Organization of Knowledge
in Libraries and the Subject-Approach to Books (1933).” Dahlberg
is also a key author responsible for coining the concepts of
KO currently approached in papers from the late 1970s and
1980s, correlating the conceptual issues of the organization
of human knowledge.
According to Hjørland (2008), two large groups of
tools-processes can characterize KO, namely: 1)
knowledge organization and representation processes: in-
dexing, cataloging, subject analysis, classification; and, 2)
knowledge organization and representation systems gen-
erated from/to these processes. The latter being primor-
dial for the effective organization.
According to Mazzocchi (2018) and Hjørland (2008), a
knowledge organization system (KOS) makes it possible
to understand that the systems and organizational concep-
tions are fundamental for retrieval, but their biggest prob-
lem is the rapid change that occurs on how society accesses
and relates to knowledge and seeks information, how
knowledge specializes itself. This difficult task common to
KOSs also pervades the reality of archives. Such a move-
ment can be seen in archives since the nineteenth century
with the reordering of the French National Archives, aim-
ing at the intellectual rearrangement of its fonds, until the
development of systems of description in a web environ-
ment. There are different ways in which we can apply
KOSs; however, we can improve archival organization
tools based on their application.
Knowledge organization systems can include, accord-
ing to Hodge (2000), classification schemes that organize
materials at a general level, subject headings that provide
more detailed access, and authority files that control vari-
ant versions of key information. They also include less-
traditional schemes, such as semantic networks and ontol-
ogies; each of them having a distinct function and techno-
logical foundation and used in a variety of social group-
ings. The ultimate goal of knowledge organization systems
is to fulfill KO’s mission: to facilitate management and ac-
cess.
Therefore, an integrative KOS is believed to aim at con-
tributing beyond its field of action, aiming to assist in the
construction of better knowledge organization systems
within the archives. Hodge (2000, 1) endorses this perspec-
tive:
Knowledge organization systems also include highly
structured vocabularies, such as thesauri, and less
traditional schemes, such as semantic networks and
ontologies. Because knowledge organization systems
are mechanisms for organizing information, they are
at the heart of every library, museum, and archive.
Thus, KOSs are mechanisms, though they are not named
as such, at the core of each system of archival organiza-
tion, in the processes of classification and description.
Souza et al. (2012) establish an interesting scheme to re-
flect the various systems, their relationships, and develop-
ments, as shown in Figure 1.
From Figure 1, it is possible to notice the complex rep-
resentation process involved in the systems of representa-
tion of knowledge, depending on its structure, its semantic
freedom, and the way in which the concepts/terms are for-
mulated.
The sizable spectrum and its possibilities are clear here.
Thus, in relation to archives, we are mostly talking about
KOSs, structured, complex, and with a semantic construc-
tion. Such a perception is possible by the very form with
which archival instruments are formulated, building a rela-
tionship between context and content based on principles
that are comprehensive and adaptable to each administra-
tive body but citing what Duranti will call archival bond
(1997), that is, the relationship that links each record, in-
crementally, to the previous and subsequent records and to
all records included in the same activity.
Based on Souza et al., scheme, concept, and relation-
ship structures are the ones that mostly apply to archival
context, because of the characteristics specified in Table 1.https://doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-7-493, am 17.01.2025, 06:30:39

Based on the table above, it is possible to conclude that a
KOS has the following characteristics: 1) representative
power (all KOSs have different levels of representative
power); 2) formalization (different levels of formaliza-
tion); 3) semantic aspects (they have terminological and
conceptual relations); 4) normalization (there is a format
in how we construct types of KOSs); and, 5) interrelation-
ship (one KOS can complement another as a thesaurus can
have relationships with an ontology).
These are five things that most archival representation
systems lack, especially semantic aspects and interrelation-
ships. We have standards for classification and archival de-
scriptions; however, these systems lack consideration of se-
mantic aspects or interrelationships from one standard to
another, from one country to another. That is a main issue
and concern for these institutions, because users have a very
particular interest when researching in archives. However,
semantic aspects of KOSs can help to make our systems
more favorable. A KOS serves as a bridge between the user’s
information needs and the material in the collection.
Therefore, it is possible to conclude that in general, all
these aspects are related to the construction of systems,
and it is believed that we can find them in the context of
archival knowledge organization systems (AKOS). In the
next section, we will argue more about these relationships.
3.0 Knowledge organization in archival science
The representation and organization of information con-
tained in records indicate the existence of an administra-
tive action. The organizational structure of a producer
body is the foundation for the development and construc-
tion of AKOSs. The ontologies, classification schemes, de-
scriptions, and indexes created from this process will have
a fundamental relationship with this aspect, but they are
not subordinated only to them.
Information science and archival science rely on the
synthesis and summary resources of information to or-
ganize and represent them (Barros and Martins 2015).
Therefore, although the process foundation is different
from that traditionally worked in the context of KO, in
essence, they are close. The goals are the same, even if the
path is different.
Classification is traditionally defended as a fundamental
function of archival science (Sousa 2003, 254 authors’ trans-
lation)—“to delineate the process of management, organi-
zation, and representation and in the context of the ar-
chives, that is, the classification must have a very strong rep-
resentative power.” Besides the fact that it is a system of or-
ganization deeply formalized and hierarchical by nature, it
also has semantic aspects in its structuring, standardization
possibilities, and is part of an interchanged process, but ar-
chival science hardly acknowledged that in its history.
Eastwood (1994) and Duranti (1997) argue that only
records together are archival records and evidence of the
activities carried out by an institution, i.e., any document
that is not organized by its function/activities, establishing
a relationship with its origin (provenance) and its original
order cannot be understood as an archival document, since
the archival document only exists and makes sense in its
relation to others. As RAD (Rules for Archival Description
2008, xxiii) dilates “the principle of provenance means that
the records created, accumulated and/or maintained by an
individual or organization must be represented together,
distinguishable from the records of any other creator.” It
is believed that this perception is fundamental and is the
basis for the system of organization and representation in
the context of the archives, but this is not the only premise.
The system in relation to its design is incomplete; there is
room to work with ontologies or thesauri, which will help
to improve its design as a system.
The basic methodology for archival management and
classification—the functional analysis— began in the
1940s with Brooks (1940), Posner (1964), and it was sys-
tematized in a more “complete” way in Schellenberg (1956
[2003]). It consists of the basic conceptual elements and
the premise of the system. It is precisely through this anal-
ysis that AKOSs are built, and they can and should be
complemented by taxonomies, ontologies, indexes, and
other structured and related forms of KOS.
In relation to the process, Foscarini (2006, 41) estab-
lished that we could define it as a preliminary investigation,
followed by top-down functional analysis and analysis of
combined bottom-up processes.
Functional classification is due to administrative stand-
ardization and the development of bureaucracy since the
end of World War II, leading to rationalization and, at the
same time, an exponential increase in the complexity of
production and use of legal-administrative documents.
This change gives us the foundation to go beyond and
think about the possible contributions of KO to archival
science.
According to Sabourin (2001, 144), a function is:
any high level purpose, responsibility, task, or activity
which is assigned to the accountability agenda of an
institution by legislation, policy or mandate; (2) typi-
cally common administrative or operational func-
tions of policy development and program and/or
delivery of goods or services; (3) a set or series of
activities (broadly speaking, a business process)
which, when carried out according to a prescribed
sequence, will result in an institution or individual
producing the expected results in goods or services
that it is mandated or delegated to provide.https://doi.org/10.5771/0943-7444-2019-7-493, am 17.01.2025, 06:30:39

Having the function as a premise of the system and func-
tional analysis as a constituent element of the representa-
tion system leaves room for it to go beyond the strictly
contextual and allows a deepening toward the content and
the decrease of subjectivity, as we see in Sousa and Araújo
Jr. (2013 and 2017), when they approach the taxonomies,
and in Barros and Gomes (2018) when approaching the
ontologies.
A key factor that makes it possible to apply a KOS in
the context of public archives is that most organizational
activities are repetitive in nature; they are instances of pro-
cesses that run frequently.
Some authors point out the problem that occurs in rela-
tion not only to classification but to a recurrent problem in
archival science that can be aided by a KOS: the naming of
classes in research tools and classification schemes. Orr
(2005, 111) established that “There is no common rule-
based classification model, either in the number of elements
or in the levels or in the naming of the classes.” Another
recurring problem is the lack of deepening theories in rela-
tion to methodologies of the field; according to Hurley
(1993, 11) “The science and methodology of functional
analysis has not yet been written.” Since the mid-1980s,
studies have focused on conceptual questions but with few
fundamentally methodological reflections. Shepherd and
Yeo (2003, 73) write that “Classification schemes are based
on an analysis of functions, processes, and activities” ISO
15489-1 (2001, 14), which is a records management stand-
ard, states: “Classification systems reflect the business of the
organization from which they derive and are normally based
on an analysis of the organization’s business activities,” and
that has been the major concern in archival theory over time.
But when we look to classification system itself as stated by
Foscarini (2006, 191) “the number of classification systems
that claim to be function-based, at a deeper glance turns out
to be just a mirror of the agency’s internal structure” not
reflecting the business functions.
However, with that critique, there are principals and fun-
damentals-based on functional analyses, but it is not the only
classification answer possible. We have developed, as Sab-
ourin (2001) or Bak (2010) dictated, a lot of case studies of
functional analyses and the development of classification
schemes but thinking only of classification’s functional basis
even when the developed systems are not that functional.
On the other hand, the archival description activity of
recent conceptualization (since the 1980s) but of tradi-
tional practice can be defined according to the Canadian
Working Group on Archival Descriptive Standards (1985,
65) as:
The description is an essential function in the pro-
cessing of archival material, and the products of this
function are finding aids of various kinds that give
the administrator control over their funds and allow
users and archivists to find the information they
need.
The description began to develop during the nineteenth
century, but it was only in the 1930s in Europe that de-
scription began to be seen as the means of making the user
independent of the archivist’s specialized knowledge, and
aimed at compiling research tools for the user, not the ar-
chivist. The activity of describing acquired a non-evalua-
tive character seen as a consequence of the recognition of
its products: to be useful for all kinds of research, it had
to serve everyone and no one in particular.
In general, the archival institution seeks to preserve the
unique identity of records, aiming at maintaining them in
a way that shows the relationships between the records and
the institution that produced them, these common prac-
tices are a basis for the descriptive work and a main con-
cern since the very beginning.
Archival description seeks relevant information to un-
derstand the relationships between the identity of the doc-
uments and their integrity as evidence of activity, seeking
to build systems of archival representation.
In this context, archival description was the function
that went through the greater process of normalization, in
a sense presented in the definitions of the framework of
Souza (2012). Weber (1989, 505) explains: “What are
norms? In a broad sense, they are pre-established guides
for action or approved by a committee ... In other words,
they are the way individuals compare and judge ... They are
a means to a specific end.” We can, according to Table 2,
visualize some of the various rules of archival description:

Based on the table above, it is possible to visualize that the
normalization in the context of the archives occurred as
part of an international project and secondarily of national
projects. Thus, AKOS reflects national contexts and reali-
ties, and this difference is fundamental to be highlighted.
When we speak of systems of organization of archival
knowledge, we are mainly talking about systems with dis-
tinct regional characteristics that must be taken into ac-
count in the elaboration of systems.
Archival description has been differently developed
from one country to another, due to their different admin-
istrative cultures. With that in mind, the same goes for the
development of classification schemes, but records are the
products of activities developed by a person or entity in
the execution of a function.
Based on Tognoli and Guimarães (2019), to understand
this process means to comprehend the network of rela-
tions between objects, agents (creators—individuals or in-
stitutions) and functions (the actions necessary to the ac-
complishment of attribution within the scope of an ad-
ministrative structure) as determinative elements to recog-
nize the archival bond. That is why a record can never be
conceived as an isolated element, especially because the
recognition of the provenance of a record allows it to be
used as evidence of activities.
Based on the literature and the text constructed in this
section, we created Figure 2:
Based on this figure, it is possible to notice that the pro-
cesses of representation in the archival context can be im-
proved with reflections and methodologies extracted from
the context of KO specifically when thinking about KOSs.
The development of ontologies and taxonomies-based
studies herein has major applications in archival classifica-
tion for the development of better systems. When we talk
about archival description, we can see major applications
of folksonomies and controlled vocabularies in a relation
of context and content. Almost all archival representation
systems lack all that KO does best: domain analyses and
KOS construction. As we pointed out, we need to work
with these methodologies, even more important in the cur-
rent status of digital records management and production.
4.0 Conclusions
The organization and representation of knowledge is a
field that contributes fundamentally to the development of
methodologies for accessing information. In this regard, a
series of developments have been presented for the devel-
opment of languages, structures, classifications, that is,
systems of knowledge organization. On the other hand,
archival science has developed in parallel, but in many mo-
ments seeking interlocutions although superficial or even
unintentional with the field of knowledge organization, as
is the case with the development of some requirements of
archival description standards, ontologies, taxonomies,
controlled vocabularies, among others.
The representation and organization of information
contained in a record indicate the possibility of the exist-
ence of an administrative action. The organizational struc-
ture of a production entity is the basis for the elaboration
and construction of the archival description and classifica-
tion systems, i.e., the ontologies, classification schemes, de-

scriptions, controlled vocabularies, and indexes created
from this process will have a fundamental relationship with
this aspect but are not subsidized only to them. As Yakel
(2003, 2) points out, representation refers to the two pro-
cesses of classification (respecting or disrespecting the or-
der) and description, as well as the creation of research in-
struments (guides, inventories, catalogs) and systems (cat-
alogs, bibliographic databases, and archival databases) re-
sulting from these activities. It is clear how the creation of
substitutes relates to representation.
Archival science has a recent theoretical development re-
garding its conceptual bases and its methodological devel-
opment. The aim was to present integrative processes of ar-
chival science theory, capable of relations with knowledge
organization, aiming at an appropriation by both fields.
Since the archives become a space of application of
knowledge organization methodologies and archival science
has a new space for discussion of its historical-conceptual
precepts, it is horizontal, that is, two fields with a possibility
of intersection. Knowledge organization is a space for im-
proving the organization processes typically linked to scien-
tific information and its developments, and it is organized
internationally as such. However, it presents methodologies,
approaches, and foundations that are very important for the
organization in the archival science environment. Although
with their methodologies and objects, no field is isolated; it
is in a relationship with each other that we can improve our
treatment methodologies.
